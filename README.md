# PHP-Database-Reader

A simple PHP reader for SQL databases. Useful for desktop applications that need to fetch user data from a database. Currently fetches the usergroup of a user from a MyBB forum, but is quite easy to modify to your need.

Supports URL headers! Example:

/backend.php?username="insertusername"
